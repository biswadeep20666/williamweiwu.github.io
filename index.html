				<p>Wei WU is currently a PhD student with the Centre for Artificial Intelligence at University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Australia.  I work with Dr. Ling Chen at UTS and Dr. Bin Li at Data61 in the area of fast big data processing, dimension reduction and feature selection. 

Prior to this, I received an M.Sc. degree in computer science from Peking University (PKU), Beijing, China, in 2014. I did the research into local search algorithms on NP problems under supervision of Prof. Kaile Su.

My research interests are fast big data processing, randomized hashing algorithms, sampling, sketching, text mining, graph mining, data mining, social network, machine learning, NP problems and local search. </p>
